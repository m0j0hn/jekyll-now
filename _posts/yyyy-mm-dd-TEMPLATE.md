Background: Statement of the motivation of this article - why was it written, what problem/solution is it supposed to describe/solve.
Paragraph describing the background of the article in more depth.
The GNU Privacy Guard [https://www.gnupg.org/](GPG) is a GNU implementation of Phil Zimmerman's Pretty Good Privacy [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy](PGP).
Both toolchains enable users to generate and manage crytpographic keys, and to encrypt and crytographically sign files.
The theory of these tools is beyond the scope of this document; please reference the links above for more info.
This document simply provides my notes on installing and using GPG so others can easily do this, too.

Prerequisites: Statement of any prerequisites for the problem & solution.


## Step 1 Title

Step 1 descriptive text

    $ step 1 commands, etc. - indented so shows up as shell - dollar-sign is user shell prompt character

    command response goes below, with no shell prompt character

Example:

From shell prompt, update Homebrew:

    $ brew update

    Updated 1 tap (caskroom/cask).

From shell prompt, install GPG:

    $ brew install gpg




Below steps, above, there can can be Known Problems & Solutions section - or maybe entire article is KPS

### Problem: (problem statement / description)

### Solution: (solution statement / description)

### Example: (example of solution in use)

### Discussion: (discussion of the solution, how found, how used, background, failure modes, caveats, etc.)

Failure looks like this, for example:
